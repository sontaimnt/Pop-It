# Pop-It 0.2 Development Branch

This branch is about the Pop It 0.2 Development branch. Here we will contribute to the new changes in Pop!It

# TODO:-

- [x] Instead of defining 25 different arrays using `button1["bg"]` extract the background and change accordingly
- [x] Refactor code like defining buttons everywhere, use `pady` and `padx` instead of `\n`
